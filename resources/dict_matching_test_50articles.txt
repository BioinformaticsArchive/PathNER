7981603:Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of lymphoid cells.The induction of cell death in lymphoid cells by glucocorticoids is one of the earliest and most thoroughly studied models of apoptosis.Although the exact mechanism by which apoptosis occurs in lymphocytes is unknown many biochemical and molecular changes have been shown to occur in these cells in response to glucocorticoids.The role of chromatin degradation and endonucleases in the apoptotic process has been closely studied, as well as the involvement of several oncogenes in glucocorticoid-induced cell lysis.In addition, the clinical importance of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in the treatment of lymphoid neoplasms has recently received increased attention.
8977297:A novel SP-1 site in the human interleukin-1 beta promoter confers preferential transcriptional activity in keratinocytes.To investigate the mechanisms of transcriptional activation of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in non-monocytic cells, we constructed a series of reporter plasmids with the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene linked to various parts of the human IL-1beta promoter and performed transient transfection experiments.We identified a promoter segment that activates transcription most efficiently in keratinocytes.Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with a 43-mer oligonucleotide derived from the functionally identified cis-acting element revealed specific complexes.By competition analysis with transcription factor consensus sequence oligonucleotides and by immunosupershift, transcription factor SP-1 or a closely related protein was shown to bind to this regulatory element.The closest match to the known SP-1 consensus sequence within the respective region is a TCCCCTCCCCT motif.Mutation of this motif almost completely, and specifically, abolished the binding of two low-mobility complexes and led to a 95% decrease of constitutive transcriptional activation of a reporter construct IL-1beta (-170/+108).Likewise, activation of this reporter construct by tumor necrosis factor-alpha depended on the SP-1 site.These observations suggest that a so-far-unrecognized SP-1 site in the human IL-1beta promoter may participate in the transcriptional regulation of this gene in keratinocytes.
8950977:Expression of Egr-1 correlates with the transformed phenotype and the type of viral latency in EBV genome positive lymphoid cell lines.In this paper we have investigated the role of Egr-1 in B cell growth regulation by examining the gene expression in a panel of B cell lines, including both EBV genome negative and EBV carrying cell lines.Egr-1 expression correlates with the cellular phenotype and the specific pattern of viral latency established within the individual cell lines.Thus, constitutive activation of Egr-1 gene is invariably associated with unrestricted expression of viral latent genes in all group III EBV genome carrying cell lines.In contrast, Egr-1 expression is abrogated in group I Burkitt tumor cells, irrespective of the EBV genome carrying status.Activated viral gene expression associated with phenotypic conversion of group I cell lines in to group II or III restores the Egr-1 gene expression.Several forms of EGR-1 protein are found within the different groups of cell lines, and the binding activity to DNA consensus sequences was investigated.Finally, time course analysis of Egr-1 expression during the early steps of EBV infection in vitro demonstrated that Egr-1 is upregulated within minutes from the initial interaction with the B lymphocyte.
8901569:Silencing of human fetal globin expression is impaired in the absence of the adult beta-globin gene activator protein EKLF.Globin genes are subject to tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific regulation.A switch from human fetal (gamma)-to adult (beta)-globin expression occurs within erythroid precursor cells of the adult lineage.Previously we and others showed by targeted gene disruption that the zinc finger gene, erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF), is required for expression of the beta-globin gene in mice, presumably through interaction with a high-affinity binding site in the proximal promoter.To examine the role of EKLF in the developmental regulation of the human gamma-globin gene we interbred EKLF heterozygotes (+/-) with mice harboring a human beta-globin yeast artificial chromosome transgene.We find that in the absence of EKLF, while human beta-globin expression is dramatically reduced, gamma-globin transcripts are elevated approximately 5-fold.Impaired silencing of gamma-globin expression identifies EKLF as the first transcription factor participating quantitatively in the gamma-globin to beta-globin switch.Our findings are compatible with a competitive model of switching in which EKLF mediates an adult stage-specific interaction between the beta-globin gene promoter and the locus control region that excludes the gamma-globin gene.
8804437:Attenuated function of a variant form of the helix-loop-helix protein, Id-3, generated by an alternative splicing mechanism.The Id family of helix-loop-helix proteins function as negative regulators of DNA binding, basic helix-loop-helix proteins in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.We report here on the identification of a 17 kDa variant of the 14 kDa Id-3 protein termed Id-3L (long version) which possesses a unique 60 amino acid carboxy-terminus generated by read through of a 'coding intron' and alternative splicing.Northern analysis revealed expression of a minor 1.1 kb Id-3L transcript together with the predominant 0.95 kb Id-3 transcript in the majority of adult human tissues analysed.The variant Id-3L protein is functionally distinguishable from conventional Id-3 since in in vitro DNA mobility shift assays, it was greatly impaired in its ability to abrogate binding of the basic helix-loop-helix protein, E47, to an E box recognition sequence.
8683110:Sublethal levels of oxidative stress stimulate transcriptional activation of c-jun and suppress IL-2 promoter activation in Jurkat T cells.Sublethal levels of oxidative stress are well known to alter T cell functional responses, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown.The current study examined the effects of oxidative stress on transcriptional activities mediated by c-Fos/c-Jun AP-1 and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT).The present results show that Jurkat T cells acutely exposed to micromolar concentrations of H2O2 exhibit substantial increases in AP-1 binding activity and the expression of c-jun but not c-fos mRNA.The preferential induction of c-jun by H2O2 did not represent redox stabilization of mRNA transcripts, and oxidative signals closely resembled PHA/PMA stimulation by effectively transactivating the full length c-jun promoter via the proximal jun1 tumor promoter-responsive element (TRE)-like promoter element.Similarly, the complexes binding the consensus AP-1 TRE and jun TRE-like motifs in cells exposed to oxidative signals or PHA/PMA were indistinguishable, being composed of c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunD.However, PHA/PMA but not oxidative signals induced the coordinate activation of reporter constructs containing the AP-1-TRE, NF-AT, and IL-2 promoter regions along with IL-2 mRNA expression.Furthermore, sublethal levels of H2O2 actively suppressed the transcriptional activation of NF-AT and IL-2 reporters as well as the expression of IL-2 mRNA in cells stimulated with PHA/PMA.Gel shift analysis revealed that oxidative suppression of NF-AT represented inhibition in the early generation of NFAT complexes rather than the binding of preformed NF-AT complexes.These results suggest that oxidative signals can positively and negatively regulate T cell transcriptional events and that changes in cellular redox can uncouple AP-1 regulation of c-jun from transcriptional up-regulation of IL-2 via NF-AT.
8780159:Absence of T-cell- and B-cell-specific transcription factors TCF-1, GATA-3, and BSAP in Hodgkin's Reed-Sternberg cells.Based on the presence of T cell receptor-beta (TcR-beta) gene rearrangements in L428 and HDLM-1 cells, the expression of CD2 in HDLM-1 cells, and the presence of immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) gene rearrangement in KM-H2 cells, some researchers have concluded that these long-term cell lines derived from patients with Hodgkin's disease are lymphoid in nature.The information obtained from these cell lines has also been used in arguments for a lymphoid origin of H-RS cells in tissue despite the frequent absence of lymphoid markers and Ig/TcR gene rearrangements in these cells.We questioned whether one can use the limited expression of lymphoid markers or the limited gene rearrangement to conclude that H-RS cells have a lymphoid origin, because these markers may be aberrant in tumor cells.In this study, we examined the expression of two T-cell-specific transcription factors (TCF-1 and GATA-3) and one B-cell-specific transcription factor (BSAP) in cultured H-RS cells by using a gel mobility shift assay.The sensitivity and specificity of this assay for determination of cell lineage have been established in a large number of cultured human and murine cell lines.All three types of H-RS cell lines were consistently negative for BSAP, TCF-1, and GATA-3.The absence of GATA-3 was confirmed in H-RS cells in tissues by an in situ hybridization technique.Virtually all B-cell lines, with the exception of some myeloma cell lines, are positive for BSAP, which is the transcription factor for promoters for several B-cell markers, including VpreB1, lambda 5, CD19, and CD20.All T-cell lines tested were positive for TCF-1 and GATA-3, which are the transcription factors for promoters for several T-cell-restricted markers, including CD2, CD3, TcR, and lck.The absence of BSAP, TCF-1, and GATA-3 clearly indicates an underlying difference between H-RS cells and lymphoid cells.
8639461:Lymphoid cell resistance to glucocorticoids in HIV infection.In humans infected with the HIV-1 virus there may be a disproportionate severity of signs and symptoms of illness compared to the fraction of CD4+ infected T-lymphoid cells.In part, this may be due to altered intercellular signalling systems and <cons lex="intracellular_signal_transduction" sem="G#other_name">intracellular signal transduction</cons>.Glucocorticoids are well known for their effects on the vitality and function of lymphoid cells.Patients with HIV infections often show elevated circulating levels of cortisol, suggesting some misfunction in the regulatory systems that maintain the levels of this critical hormone.At the cellular level, it is known that both acute HIV infection and glucocorticoids can cause apoptotic cell death in thymic lymphocytes.However, chronically HIV-infected cells appear to be resistant to glucocorticoid-evoked cell death.Glucocorticoid receptor-ligand binding studies on patients' cells have shown reduced affinity between the receptor binding sites and test steroids.In vitro, chronically HIV-infected cells of the lymphoid CEM line displayed resistance to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis.These cells showed reduced numbers of binding sites with little alteration in apparent affinity between ligand and receptor.Thus it appears that there may often be malfunction of the normal glucocorticoid response in HIV-infected cells probably due to altered interactions between the glucocorticoid receptor and its hormone.Such alterations may have clinical consequences, including the possibility of a relatively longer life span of infected CD4+ T-lymphocytes, as well as systemic effects of chronically elevated cortisol level.
8621390:Transcriptional regulation of the interleukin-2 gene in normal human peripheral blood T cells.Convergence of costimulatory signals and differences from transformed T cells.To study transcriptional regulation in normal human T cells, we have optimized conditions for transient transfection.Interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter-reporter gene behavior closely parallels the endogenous gene in response to T cell receptor and costimulatory signals.As assessed with mutagenized promoters, the most important IL-2 cis-regulatory elements in normal T cells are the proximal AP-1 site and the NF- kappaB site.Both primary activation, with phytohemagglutinin or antibodies to CD3, and costimulation, provided by pairs of CD2 antibodies or B7-positive (B cells) or B7-negative (endothelial) accessory cells, are mediated through the same cis-elements.Interestingly, the nuclear factor of activated T cell sites are much less important in normal T cells than in Jurkat T cells.We conclude that IL-2 transcriptional regulation differs in tumor cell lines compared with normal T cells and that different costimulatory signals converge on the same cis-elements in the IL-2 promoter.
10364157:Direct interaction of hematopoietic transcription factors PU.1 and GATA-1: functional antagonism in erythroid cells.Malignant transformation usually inhibits terminal cell differentiation but the precise mechanisms involved are not understood.PU.1 is a hematopoietic-specific Ets family transcription factor that is required for development of some lymphoid and myeloid lineages.PU.1 can also act as an oncoprotein as activation of its expression in erythroid precursors by proviral insertion or transgenesis causes erythroleukemias in mice.Restoration of terminal differentiation in the mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells requires a decline in the level of PU.1, indicating that PU.1 can block erythroid differentiation.Here we investigate the mechanism by which PU.1 interferes with erythroid differentiation.We find that PU.1 interacts directly with GATA-1, a zinc finger transcription factor required for erythroid differentiation.Interaction between PU.1 and GATA-1 requires intact DNA-binding domains in both proteins.PU.1 represses GATA-1-mediated transcriptional activation.Both the DNA binding and transactivation domains of PU.1 are required for repression and both domains are also needed to block terminal differentiation in MEL cells.We also show that ectopic expression of PU.1 in Xenopus embryos is sufficient to block erythropoiesis during normal development.Furthermore, introduction of exogenous GATA-1 in both MEL cells and Xenopus embryos and explants relieves the block to erythroid differentiation imposed by PU.1.Our results indicate that the stoichiometry of directly interacting but opposing transcription factors may be a crucial determinant governing processes of normal differentiation and malignant transformation.
10330189:Nuclear localization and formation of beta-catenin-lymphoid enhancer factor 1 complexes are not sufficient for activation of gene expression.In response to activation of the <cons lex="Wnt_signaling_pathway" sem="G#other_name">Wnt signaling pathway</cons>, beta-catenin accumulates in the nucleus, where it cooperates with LEF/TCF (for lymphoid enhancer factor and T-cell factor) transcription factors to activate gene expression.The mechanisms by which beta-catenin undergoes this shift in location and participates in activation of gene transcription are unknown.We demonstrate here that beta-catenin can be imported into the nucleus independently of LEF/TCF binding, and it may also be exported from nuclei.We have introduced a small deletion within beta-catenin (Delta19) that disrupts binding to LEF-1, E-cadherin, and APC but not axin.This Delta19 beta-catenin mutant localizes to the nucleus because it may not be efficiently sequestered in the cytoplasm.The nuclear localization of Delta19 definitively demonstrates that the mechanisms by which beta-catenin localizes in the nucleus are completely independent of LEF/TCF factors.beta-Catenin and LEF-1 complexes can activate reporter gene expression in a transformed T-lymphocyte cell line (Jurkat) but not in normal T lymphocytes, even though both factors are nuclear.Thus, localization of both factors to the nucleus is not sufficient for activation of gene expression.Excess beta-catenin can squelch reporter gene activation by LEF-1-beta-catenin complexes but not activation by the transcription factor VP16.Taken together, these data suggest that a third component is necessary for gene activation and that this third component may vary with cell type.
10409763:The Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein latent membrane protein 1 engages the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated proteins TRADD and receptor-interacting protein (RIP) but does not induce apoptosis or require RIP for NF-kappaB activation.A site in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transforming protein LMP1 that constitutively associates with the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1)-associated death domain protein TRADD to mediate NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation is critical for long-term lymphoblastoid cell proliferation.We now find that LMP1 signaling through TRADD differs from <cons lex="TNFR1_signaling" sem="G#other_name">TNFR1 signaling</cons> through TRADD.LMP1 needs only 11 amino acids to activate NF-kappaB or synergize with TRADD in NF-kappaB activation, while TNFR1 requires approximately 70 residues.Further, LMP1 does not require TRADD residues 294 to 312 for NF-kappaB activation, while TNFR1 requires TRADD residues 296 to 302.LMP1 is partially blocked for NF-kappaB activation by a TRADD mutant consisting of residues 122 to 293.Unlike TNFR1, LMP1 can interact directly with receptor-interacting protein (RIP) and stably associates with RIP in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines.Surprisingly, LMP1 does not require RIP for NF-kappaB activation.Despite constitutive association with TRADD or RIP, LMP1 does not induce apoptosis in EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma or human embryonic kidney 293 cells.These results add a different perspective to the molecular interactions through which LMP1, TRADD, and RIP participate in B-lymphocyte activation and growth.
10357820:Repression by Ikaros and Aiolos is mediated through histone deacetylase complexes.Here we show that the lymphoid lineage-determining factors Ikaros and Aiolos can function as strong transcriptional repressors.This function is mediated through two repression domains and is dependent upon the promoter context and cell type.Repression by Ikaros proteins correlates with hypo-acetylation of core histones at promoter sites and is relieved by histone deacetylase inhibitors.Consistent with these findings, Ikaros and its repression domains can interact in vivo and in vitro with the mSin3 family of co-repressors which bind to histone deacetylases.Based on these and our recent findings of associations between Ikaros and Mi-2-HDAC, we propose that Ikaros family members modulate gene expression during lymphocyte development by recruiting distinct histone deacetylase complexes to specific promoters.
10364260:Human alveolar macrophages are markedly deficient in REF-1 and AP-1 DNA binding activity.Although many functions of human alveolar macrophages are altered compared with their precursor cell, the blood monocyte (monocyte), the reason(s) for these functional changes have not been determined.We recently reported that human alveolar macrophages do not express AP-1 DNA binding activity (Monick, M. M., Carter, A. B., Gudmundsson, G., Geist, L. J., and Hunninghake, G. W. (1998) Am. J. Physiol. 275, L389-L397).To determine why alveolar macrophages do not express AP-1 DNA binding activity, we first showed that there was not a decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN proteins that make up the AP-1 complex.There was, however, a significant difference in the amounts of the nuclear protein, REF-1 (which regulates AP-1 DNA binding by altering the redox status of FOS and JUN proteins), in alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes.In addition, in vitro differentiation of monocytes to a macrophage-like cell resulted in decreased amounts of REF-1.Finally, addition of REF-1 from activated monocytes to alveolar macrophage nuclear proteins resulted in a marked increase in AP-1 DNA binding.These studies strongly suggest that the process of differentiation of monocytes into alveolar macrophages is associated with a loss of REF-1 and AP-1 activity.This observation may explain, in part, some of the functional differences observed for alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes.
9442388:Inefficient termination of antigen responses in NF-ATp-deficient mice.In order to elucidate the role of NF-ATp, one of the most prominent members of family of NF-AT transcription factors in peripheral T lymphocytes, in T cell activation and differentiation we created NF-ATp-deficient mice by gene targeting.Such NF-ATp-/- mice are born and appear to develop a normal immune system.Apart from clear-cut defects in the synthesis of mRNAs for Th2-type lymphokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13, in primary and secondary stimulations of spleen cells in vitro, of a distinct impaired deletion of V beta 11+/CD4+ T lymphocytes from these mice was detected after superantigen injection.Moreover, NF-ATp-/- mice older than 6 weeks show an 2-5 fold increase in number of lymphocytes.This is correlated with an increased expression of activation markers CD44 and CD69 and decreased expression of CD62.
9858563:The B29 (immunoglobulin beta-chain) gene is a genetic target for early B-cell factor.Early B-cell factor (EBF) is a transcription factor suggested as essential for early B-lymphocyte development by findings in mice where the coding gene has been inactivated by homologous disruption.This makes the identification of genetic targets for this transcription factor pertinent for the understanding of early B-cell development.The lack of B29 transcripts, coding for the beta subunit of the B-cell receptor complex, in pro-B cells from EBF-deficient mice suggested that B29 might be a genetic target for EBF.We here present data suggesting that EBF interacts with three independent sites within the mouse B29 promoter.Furthermore, ectopic expression of EBF in HeLa cells activated a B29 promoter-controlled reporter construct 13-fold and induced a low level of expression from the endogenous B29 gene.Finally, mutations in the EBF binding sites diminished B29 promoter activity in pre-B cells while the same mutations did not have as striking an effect on the promoter function in B-cell lines of later differentiation stages.These data suggest that the B29 gene is a genetic target for EBF in early B-cell development.
9952386:Tuberculosis and chronic hepatitis B virus infection in Africans and variation in the vitamin D receptor gene.The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, is an important immunoregulatory hormone [1].Its effects are exerted by interaction with the vitamin D receptor, which is present on human monocytes and activated T and B lymphocytes.Variation in the vitamin D receptor gene was typed in 2015 subjects from large case-control studies of three major infectious diseases: tuberculosis, malaria, and hepatitis B virus.Homozygotes for a polymorphism at codon 352 (genotype tt) were significantly underrepresented among those with tuberculosis (chi2=6.22, 1 df, P=.01) and persistent hepatitis B infection (chi2=6.25, 1 df, P=.01) but not in subjects with clinical malaria compared with the other genotypes.Therefore, this genetic variant, which predisposes to low bone mineral density in many populations, may confer resistance to certain infectious diseases.
9315663:Tissue transglutaminase-dependent posttranslational modification of the retinoblastoma gene product in promonocytic cells undergoing apoptosis.The retinoblastoma gene product (pRB) plays an important role in controlling both cell release from the G1 phase and apoptosis.We show here that in the early phases of apoptosis, pRB is posttranslationally modified by a tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-catalyzed reaction.In fact, by employing a novel haptenized lysis synthetic substrate which allows the isolation of glutaminyl-tTG substrates in vivo, we identified pRB as a potential tTG substrate in U937 cells undergoing apoptosis.In keeping with this finding, we showed that apoptosis of U937 cells is characterized by the rapid disappearance of the 105,000- to 110,000-molecular-weight pRB forms concomitantly with the appearance of a smear of immunoreactive products with a molecular weight of greater than 250,000.The shift in pRB molecular weight was reproduced by adding exogenous purified tTG to extracts obtained from viable U937 cells and was prevented by dansylcadaverine, a potent enzyme inhibitor.The effect of the pRB posttranslational modification during apoptosis was investigated by determining the E2F-1 levels and by isolating and characterizing pRB-null clones from U937 cells.Notably, the lack of pRB in these U937-derived clones renders these p53-null cells highly resistant to apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal, calphostin C, and ceramide.Taken together, these data suggest that tTG, acting on the pRB protein, might play an important role in the cell progression through the death program.
9305919:STAT3 is a serine kinase target in T lymphocytes.Interleukin 2 and T cell antigen receptor signals converge upon serine 727.Interleukin 2 (IL-2) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 3 and 5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription).We now show that IL-2 regulation of STAT3 proteins in T cells is a complex response involving activation of two forms of STAT3: 90-kDa STAT3alpha and an 83-kDa carboxyl-terminal truncated STAT3beta.The phosphorylation of STAT proteins on serine residues is also required for competent STAT transcription.A critical serine phosphorylation site in STAT3alpha is at position 727.In this study we have produced an antisera specific for STAT3alpha proteins phosphorylated on serine 727 and used this to monitor the phosphorylation of this residue during T lymphocyte activation.Our results show that phosphorylation of STAT3alpha on serine 727 is not constitutive in quiescent T cells but can be induced by the cytokine IL-2.Interestingly, triggering of the T cell antigen receptor complex or activation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters also induces phosphorylation of serine 727 but without simultaneously inducing STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or DNA binding.Hence, the present results show that STAT3 serine phosphorylation can be regulated independently of the tyrosine phosphorylation of this molecule.IL-2 and T cell antigen receptor complex induction of STAT3alpha serine 727 phosphorylation is dependent on the activity of the <cons lex="MEK/ERK_pathway" sem="G#other_name">MEK/ERK pathway</cons>.Previous studies have identified <cons lex="H-7-sensitive_kinase_pathway" sem="G#other_name">H-7-sensitive kinase pathways</cons> that regulate STAT3 DNA binding.We show that <cons lex="H-7-sensitive_pathway" sem="G#other_name">H-7-sensitive pathways</cons> regulate STAT3 DNA binding in T cells.Nevertheless, we show that H-7-sensitive kinases do not regulate STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or phosphorylation of serine 727.These results thus show that STAT3 proteins are targets for <cons lex="multiple_kinase_pathway" sem="G#other_name">multiple kinase pathways</cons> in T cells and can integrate signals from both cytokine receptors and antigen receptors.
9427533:Competent transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II in cell-free extracts from xeroderma pigmentosum groups B and D in an optimized RNA transcription assay.The human autosomal recessive disease, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), can result from mutations in any one of seven genes, designated XPA through XPG.Of these, the XPB and XPD genes encode proteins that are subunits of a general transcription factor, TFIIH, involved in both nucleotide excision repair (NER) and initiation of mRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II.In humans, mutation of the XPB or XPD gene impairs NER, resulting in hyper-sensitivity to sunlight and greatly increased skin tumor formation.However, no transcription deficiency has been demonstrated in either XP-B or XP-D.We have employed an optimized cell-free RNA transcription assay to analyze transcription activity of XP-B and XP-D.Although the growth rate was normal, the XP-B and XP-D cells contained reduced amounts of TFIIH.Extracts prepared from XP-B and XP-D lymphoblastoid cells exhibited similar transcription activity from the adenovirus major late promoter when compared to that in extracts from normal cells.Thus, we conclude that the XP-B and XP-D lymphoblastoid cells do not have impaired RNA transcription activity.We consider the possible consequences of the reduced cellular content of TFIIH for the clinical symptoms in XP-B or XP-D patients, and discuss a 'conditional phenotype' that may involve an impairment of cellular function only under certain growth conditions.
9339356:Molecular characterization and pattern of tissue expression of the gene for neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin from humans.Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a 25-kDa lipocalin first identified as a protein stored in specific granules of the human neutrophil.The protein is believed to bind small lipophilic substances such as bacterial derived formylpeptides and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and might function as a modulator of inflammation.To characterize the regulation of NGAL further, we have cloned and sequenced a 5869-bp region of the NGAL gene including 1695 bp of the 5' nontranscribed region and a 3696-bp coding region encompassing seven exons and six introns.The transcriptional start sites were identified by an RNase protection assay.The NGAL gene is highly homologous to the mouse gene 24p3.NGAL was expressed in bone marrow and in tissues that are prone to exposure to microorganisms.Potential cis-acting elements were identified in the promoter region of the NGAL gene by computer analysis and include binding sites for CTF/CBP, the hematopoietic transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1, and the LPS-inducible factor NF-kappa B.
9247567:Cyclosporin A interferes with the inducible degradation of NF-kappa B inhibitors, but not with the processing of p105/NF-kappa B1 in T cells.The transcription factor NF-kappa B controls the induction of numerous cytokine promoters during the activation of T lymphocytes.Inhibition of T cell activation by the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 exerts a suppressive effect on the induction of these NF-kappa B-controlled cytokine promoters.We show for human Jurkat T leukemia cells, as well as human and mouse primary T lymphocytes, that this inhibitory effect is accompanied by an impaired nuclear translocation of the Rel proteins c-Rel, RelA/p65 and NF-kappa B1/p50, whereas the nuclear appearance of RelB remains unaffected.CsA does not interfere with the synthesis of Rel proteins, but prevents the inducible degradation of cytosolic NF-kappa B inhibitors I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta upon T cell activation.CsA neither inhibits the processing of the NF-kappa B1 precursor p105 to p50, nor does it "stabilize" the C-terminal portion of p105, I kappa B gamma, which is degraded during p105 processing to mature p50.These results indicate that CsA interferes with a specific event in the signal-induced degradation of I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta, but does not affect the processing of NF-kappa B1/p105 to p50.
9185506:Glucocorticoid-mediated repression of cytokine gene transcription in human arteritis-SCID chimeras.Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a vasculitic syndrome that preferentially affects medium and large-sized arteries.Glucocorticoid therapy resolves clinical symptoms within hours to days, but therapy has to be continued over several years to prevent disease relapses.It is not known whether and how glucocorticoids affect the function of the inflammatory infiltrate or why the disease persists subclinically despite chronic treatment.GCA is self-sustained in temporal arteries engrafted into SCID mice, providing a model in which the mechanisms of action and limitations of glucocorticoid therapy can be examined in vivo.Administration of dexamethasone to temporal artery-SCID chimeras for 1 wk induced a partial suppression of T cell and macrophage function as indicated by the reduced tissue concentrations of IL-2, IL-1beta, and IL-6 mRNA, and by the diminished expression of inducible NO synthase.In contrast, synthesis of IFN-gamma mRNA was only slightly decreased, and expression of TGF-beta1 was unaffected.These findings correlated with activation of the IkappaBalpha gene and blockade of the nuclear translocation of NFkappaB in the xenotransplanted tissue.Dose-response experiments suggested that steroid doses currently used in clinical medicine are suboptimal in repressing NFkappaB-mediated cytokine production in the inflammatory lesions.Chronic steroid therapy was able to deplete the T cell products IL-2 and IFN-gamma, whereas the activation of tissue-infiltrating macrophages was only partially affected.IL-1beta transcription was abrogated; in contrast, TGF-beta1 mRNA synthesis was steroid resistant.The persistence of TGF-beta1-transcribing macrophages, despite paralysis of T cell function, may provide an explanation for the chronicity of the disease, and may identify a novel therapeutic target in this inflammatory vasculopathy.
9001422:Elf-2, a rhombotin-2 binding ets transcription factor: discovery and potential role in T cell leukemia.Rhombotin-2 (RBTN-2) is a proto-oncogene only in the context of T lymphocytes.We postulated that the oncogenic effect of RBTN-2 in T cells is likely mediated by binding protein(s) with T cell-specific expression.By screening a T cell cDNA library, we identified a novel ets transcription factor that binds RBTN-2.This protein was named elf-2 because its DNA-binding domain is virtually identical to that of ets family member elf-1.Northern analyses showed similar levels of two elf-2 transcripts (3.5 kb and 3.8 kb) in all tissues except thymus.Thymocytes expressed four- to 10-fold greater amounts of the 3.5 kb transcript than other tissues.Sequence analyses of cDNA clones indicated that these transcripts encode proteins differing only at their amino termini, and likely represent alternatively spliced isoforms.These isoforms (elf-2a and elf-2b) contain identical RBTN-2 binding regions and DNA-binding domains.Elf-2b lacks a putative transactivation domain.The expression patterns suggest that RBTN-2 normally interacts equally with elf-2a and elf-2b.In contrast, when RBTN-2 is inappropriately expressed in T cells, RBTN-2 would interact predominantly with elf-2b; this interaction may lead to T cell proliferation.
9918824:Requirement of GATA-1 and p45 NF-E2 expression in butyric acid-induced erythroid differentiation.Butyric acid (BA) is known to induce overexpression of fetal hemoglobin and then erythroid differentiation.Therefore, BA is currently under clinical investigation as a potential therapy for the treatment of sickle cell disease and cancer.Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved in BA-induced differentiation remain largely unknown.Previous reports have shown that BA-induced overexpression of erythroid genes occurred at the transcriptional level, suggesting the involvement of erythroid transcription factors.Here, we intend to demonstrate the requirement of GATA-1 and NF-E2 transcription factors in the BA-induced erythroid differentiation of human leukemic K562 cells.Time-course experiments showed that nuclear levels of GATA-1 and p45 NF-E2 proteins increased during BA treatment.Moreover, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting either GATA-1 or p45 NF-E2 proteins inhibited both protein expression and BA-induced differentiation.In contrast, BA-induced cell growth inhibition was not affected.These results provide the first direct evidence for the requirement of GATA-1 and NF-E2 in BA-induced differentiation process.
9819382:TAL1 and LIM-only proteins synergistically induce retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 expression in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by acting as cofactors for GATA3.Previously, we have shown that TAL1 and the LIM-only protein gene (LMO) are regularly coactivated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).This observation is likely to relate to the findings that TAL1 and LMO are highly synergistic in T-cell tumorigenesis in double-transgenic mice.To understand the molecular mechanisms of functional synergy between TAL1 and LMO in tumorigenesis and transcriptional regulation, we tried to identify downstream target genes regulated by TAL1 and LMO by a subtractive PCR method.One of the isolated genes, that for retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2), was regularly expressed in most of the T-ALL cell lines that coexpressed TAL1 and LMO.Exogenously transfected TAL1 and LMO, but not either alone, induced RALDH2 expression in a T-ALL cell line, HPB-ALL, not expressing endogeneous TAL1 or LMO.The RALDH2 transcripts in T-ALL were, however, mostly initiated within the second intron.Promoter analysis revealed that a GATA site in a cryptic promoter in the second intron was essential and sufficient for the TAL1- and LMO-dependent transcriptional activation, and GATA3 binds to this site.In addition, forced expression of GATA3 potentiated the induction of RALDH2 by TAL1 and LMO, and these three factors formed a complex in vivo.Furthermore, a TAL1 mutant not binding to DNA also activated the transcription of RALDH2 in the presence of LMO and GATA3.Collectively, we have identified the RALDH2 gene as a first example of direct transcriptional target genes regulated by TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL.In this case, TAL1 and LMO act as cofactors for GATA3 to activate the transcription of RALDH2
9710448:Highly polarized HLA class II antigen processing and presentation by human intestinal epithelial cells.The high concentration of foreign antigen in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract is separated from the underlying lymphocytes by a single cell layer of polarized epithelium.Intestinal epithelial cells can express HLA class II antigens and may function as antigen-presenting cells to CD4(+) T cells within the intestinal mucosa.Using tetanus toxoid specific and HLA-DR-restricted T lymphocytes, we show that polarized intestinal epithelial cells directed to express HLA-DR molecules are able to initiate class II processing only after internalization of antigen from their apical surface.Coexpression of the class II transactivator CIITA in these cells, which stimulates highly efficient class II processing without the characteristic decline in barrier function seen in polarized monolayers treated with the proinflammatory cytokine gamma-IFN, facilitates antigen processing from the basolateral surface.In both cases, peptide presentation to T cells via class II molecules was restricted to the basolateral surface.These data indicate a highly polarized functional architecture for antigen processing and presentation by intestinal epithelial cells, and suggest that the functional outcome of antigen processing by the intestinal epithelium is both dependent on the cellular surface at which the foreign antigen is internalized and by the underlying degree of mucosal inflammation
9783909:Differential RNA display identifies novel genes associated with decreased vitamin D receptor expression.To characterize further the function of the intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR), we have developed stable transfectant variants of a vitamin D-responsive cell line (U937) which express either decreased or increased numbers of VDR.In this study we have analyzed changes in gene expression associated with this variable VDR expression.Initial experiments indicated that a 50% decrease in VDR levels was associated with a 2-fold increase in cell proliferation and a similar rise in c-myc mRNA expression.Further studies were carried out using differential RNA display (DD).Sequence analysis of DD products revealed two cDNAs with identity to known gene products: the catalytic sub-unit of DNA-protein kinase (DNA-PK(CS)), and the peroxisomal enzyme 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type IV (17beta-HSD IV).Northern analysis confirmed that expression of both mRNAs was reduced in cells with decreased numbers of VDR.Down-regulation of 17beta-HSD IV mRNA expression was associated with enhanced estradiol inactivation by U937 cells, suggesting a link between <cons lex="estrogenic_pathway" sem="G#other_name">estrogenic pathways</cons> and cell proliferation.Further Northern analyses indicated that there was no significant change in 17beta-HSD IV or DNA-PK(CS) mRNA levels following treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3, although expression of both genes varied with changes in cell proliferation.These data suggest that, in addition to its established role as a hormone-dependent trans-activator, VDR may influence gene expression by ligand-independent mechanisms.
9794238:Relationship between IkappaBalpha constitutive expression, TNFalpha synthesis, and apoptosis in EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cells.In order to understand the role of NF-kappaB in EBV transformation we have established stably transfected IkappaBalpha into lymphoblastoid cells.Two clones were obtained in which the loss of NF-kappaB binding activity correlated with the constitutive expression of the transgenic IkappaBalpha.Protein latency expression was determined by immunocytochemistry.Expression of surface markers, intracytoplasmic content of cytokines cell cycle analysis after BrdU incorporation and DNA staining with propidium iodide were studied by flow cytometry.Percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by in-situ labelling of DNA strand breaks.No significative changes in EBV latency nor in cell surface marker expression was found.In contrast, intracytoplasmic TNFalpha levels were strongly reduced in transfected clones.Furthermore, 30% of IkappaBalpha transfected cells were apoptotic after 8 h of TNFalpha treatment.This correlated with a strong reduction of BrdU incorporation after 24 h of TNFalpha treatment.No effect was seen with non transfected cells or with cells transfected with a control plasmid.Our results suggest that the TNFalpha gene could be one of the targets of NF-kappaB in EBV infected cells and that NF-kappaB protects EBV-infected cells from apoptosis induced by TNFalpha, which may favour the proliferative effect of this cytokine.
9727000:Two-site interaction of nuclear factor of activated T cells with activated calcineurin.Transcription factors belonging to the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family regulate the expression of cytokine genes and other inducible genes during the immune response.The functions of NFAT proteins are directly controlled by the calcium- and calmodulin- dependent phosphatase calcineurin.Here we show that the binding of calcineurin to NFAT is substantially increased when calcineurin is activated with calmodulin and calcium.FK506.FKBP12 drug-immunophilin complexes inhibited the interaction of NFAT with activated calcineurin much more effectively than they inhibited the interaction with inactive calcineurin, suggesting that part of the interaction with activated calcineurin involved the enzyme active site.We have previously shown that NFAT is targeted to inactive calcineurin at a region distinct from the calcineurin active site (Aramburu, J., Garcia-Cozar, F. J., Raghavan, A., Okamura, H., Rao, A., and Hogan, P. G. (1998) Mol. Cell 1, 627-637); this region is also involved in NFAT binding to activated calcineurin, since binding is inhibited by an NFAT peptide spanning the calcineurin docking site on NFAT.The interacting surfaces are located on the catalytic domain of the calcineurin A chain and on an 86-amino acid fragment of the NFAT regulatory domain.NFAT binding to the calcineurin catalytic domain was inhibited by the calcineurin autoinhibitory domain and the RII substrate peptide, which bind in the calcineurin active site, as well as by the NFAT docking site peptide, which binds to a region of calcineurin distinct from the active site.We propose that, in resting cells, NFAT is targeted to a region of the calcineurin catalytic domain that does not overlap the calcineurin active site.Upon cell activation, displacement of the autoinhibitory domain by calmodulin binding allows NFAT to bind additionally to the calcineurin active site, thus positioning NFAT for immediate dephosphorylation at functional phosphoserine residues.
9733836:The Epstein-Barr virus Rta protein activates lytic cycle genes and can disrupt latency in B lymphocytes.The transition of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from latency into the lytic cycle is associated with the expression of two immediate-early viral genes, BZLF1 and BRLF1.Overexpression of ZEBRA, the product of BZLF1, is sufficient to disrupt latency in B lymphocytes and epithelial cells by stimulating expression of lytic cycle genes, including BRLF1.The BRLF1 product Rta functions as a transcriptional activator in both B lymphocytes and epithelial cells.However, Rta has recently been reported to disrupt latency in an epithelial specific manner (S. Zalani, E. Holley-Guthrie, and S. Kenney, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:9194-9199, 1996).Here we demonstrate that expression of Rta is also sufficient for disruption of latency in a permissive B-cell line.In HH514-16 cells, transfection of Rta leads to synthesis of ZEBRA, viral DNA replication, and late gene expression.However, Rta by itself is less potent than ZEBRA in the ability to activate most early and late lytic cycle genes.In light of previous work implicating ZEBRA in the activation of Rta, we suggest a cooperative model for EBV entry into the lytic cycle.Expression of either BZLF1 or BRLF1 triggers expression of the other immediate-early factor, and together these activators act individually or in synergy on downstream targets to activate the viral lytic cycle.
9616163:MLL and CALM are fused to AF10 in morphologically distinct subsets of acute leukemia with translocation t(10;11): both rearrangements are associated with a poor prognosis.The translocation t(10;11)(p13;q14) has been observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as well as acute myeloid leukemia (AML).A recent study showed a MLL/AF10 fusion in all cases of AML with t(10;11) and various breakpoints on chromosome 11 ranging from q13 to q23.We recently cloned CALM (Clathrin Assembly Lymphoid Myeloid leukemia gene), the fusion partner of AF10 at 11q14 in the monocytic cell line U937.To further define the role of these genes in acute leukemias, 10 cases (9 AML and 1 ALL) with cytogenetically proven t(10;11)(p12-14;q13-21) and well-characterized morphology, immunophenotype, and clinical course were analyzed.Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed with 2 YACs flanking the CALM region, a YAC contig of the MLL region, and a YAC spanning the AF10 breakpoint.Rearrangement of at least one of these genes was detected in all cases with balanced t(10;11).In 4 cases, including 3 AML with immature morphology (1 AML-M0 and 2 AML-M1) and 1 ALL, the signals of the CALM YACS were separated in interphase cells, indicating a translocation breakpoint within the CALM region.MLL was rearranged in 3 AML with myelomonocytic differentiation (2 AML-M2 and 1 AML-M5), including 1 secondary AML.In all 3 cases, a characteristic immunophenotype was identified (CD4+, CD13-, CD33+, CD65s+).AF-10 was involved in 5 of 6 evaluable cases, including 1 case without detectable CALM or MLL rearrangement.In 2 complex translocations, none of the three genes was rearranged.All cases had a remarkably poor prognosis, with a mean survival of 9.6 +/- 6.6 months.For the 7 AML cases that were uniformly treated according to the AMLCG86/92 protocols, disease-free and overall survival was significantly worse than for the overall study group (P = .03 and P = .01, respectively).We conclude that the t(10;11)(p13;q14) indicates CALM and MLL rearrangements in morphologically distinct subsets of acute leukemia and may be associated with a poor prognosis.
9663467:Thrombopoietin supports in vitro erythroid differentiation via its specific receptor c-Mpl in a human leukemia cell line.Thrombopoietin (TPO) acts on megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis in vitro and in vivo.We isolated a novel subline, UT-7/GMT, from the human leukemia cell line UT-7/GM (N. Komatsu, et al., Blood, 89: 4021-4033, 1997).A small population of UT-7/GM cells positively stained for hemoglobin (Hb) after a 7-day exposure to TPO.More than 50% of TPO-treated UT-7/GMT cells positively stained for Hb.Using UT-7/GMT cells, we examined how TPO promotes hemoglobinization.TPO induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the TPO receptor but not the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor.There was no competition between TPO and EPO for binding to EPO receptor.These findings suggest that TPO has a direct effect on hemoglobinization via a specific receptor on UT-7/GMT cells.Isoelectric focusing demonstrated that TPO induced fetal and adult Hb synthesis, whereas EPO induced embryonic, fetal, and adult Hb synthesis.Thus, our data suggest that TPO has a distinct action on erythropoiesis.
8430069:The c-rel protooncogene product represses NF-kappa B p65-mediated transcriptional activation of the long terminal repeat of type 1 human immunodeficiency virus.The long terminal repeat (LTR) of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and the 5' regulatory region of the gene encoding the interleukin 2 receptor alpha subunit (IL-2R alpha) share functional kappa B enhancer elements involved in the regulation of these inducible transcription units during T-cell activation.These kappa B enhancer elements are recognized by a structurally related family of interactive proteins that includes p50, p65, and the product of the c-rel protooncogene (c-Rel).Recent biochemical studies have shown that p65 and p50 form the prototypical NF-kappa B complex, which is rapidly translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during T-cell activation.This intracellular signaling complex potently stimulates kappa B-directed transcription from either the HIV-1 LTR or the IL-2R alpha promoter via the strong transactivation domain present in p65.We now demonstrate that nuclear expression of human c-Rel, which is induced by either phorbol ester or tumor necrosis factor alpha with delayed kinetics relative to p65, markedly represses p65-mediated activation of these transcription units.These inhibitory effects of c-Rel correlate with its DNA-binding activity but not with its ability to heterodimerize with p50, suggesting that c-Rel inhibition involves competition with p50/p65 for occupancy of the kappa B enhancer element.Together, these findings suggest that one function of c-Rel is as a physiologic repressor of the HIV-1 LTR and IL-2R alpha promoters, serving to efficiently counter the strong transcriptional activating effects of p65.
8387893:Mice deficient for the 55 kd tumor necrosis factor receptor are resistant to endotoxic shock, yet succumb to L. monocytogenes infection.The multiple biological activities of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are mediated by two distinct cell surface receptors of 55 kd (TNFRp55) and 75 kd (TNFRp75).Using gene targeting, we generated a TNFRp55-deficient mouse strain.Cells from TNFRp55-/-mutant mice lack expression of TNFRp55 but display normal numbers of high affinity TNFRp75 molecules.Thymocyte development and lymphocyte populations are unaltered, and clonal deletion of potentially self-reactive T cells is not impaired.However, TNF signaling is largely abolished, as judged by the failure of TNF to induce NF-kappa B in T lymphocytes from TNFRp55-deficient mice.The loss of TNFRp55 function renders mice resistant to lethal dosages of either lipopolysaccharides or S. aureus enterotoxin B.In contrast, TNFRp55-deficient mice are severely impaired to clear L. monocytogenes and readily succumb to infection.Thus, the 55 kd TNFR plays a decisive role in the host's defense against microorganisms and their pathogenic factors.
8392092:Minimally modified low density lipoprotein-induced inflammatory responses in endothelial cells are mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate.We have previously shown that minimally oxidized LDL (MM-LDL) activated endothelial cells to increase their interaction with monocytes but not neutrophils, inducing monocyte but not neutrophil binding and synthesis of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and monocyte colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF).In the present studies we have examined the signaling pathways by which this monocyte-specific response is induced.Both induction of monocyte binding and mRNA levels for M-CSF by MM-LDL were not inhibited in protein kinase C-depleted endothelial cells.A number of our studies indicate that cAMP is the second messenger for the effects of MM-LDL cited above.Incubation of endothelial cells with MM-LDL caused a 173% increase in intracellular cAMP levels.Agents which increased cAMP levels, including cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, dibutyryl cAMP, and isoproterenol mimicked the actions of MM-LDL.Agents which elevated cAMP were also shown to activate NF kappa B, suggesting a role for this transcription factor in activation of monocyte-endothelial interactions.Although endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM) mRNA synthesis can be regulated by NF kappa B, ELAM was not expressed and ELAM mRNA was only slightly elevated in response to MM-LDL.We present evidence that induction of neutrophil binding by LPS is actually suppressed by agents that elevated cAMP levels.
1431113:Redox status of cells influences constitutive or induced NF-kappa B translocation and HIV long terminal repeat activity in human T and monocytic cell lines.We have tested the hypothesis that cellular activation events occurring in T lymphocytes and monocytes and mediated through translocation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B are dependent upon the constitutive redox status of these cells.We used phenolic, lipid-soluble, chain-breaking antioxidants (butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), nordihydroquairetic acid, or alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) to show that peroxyl radical scavenging in unstimulated and PMA- or TNF-stimulated cells blocks the functions depending on NF-kappa B activation.BHA was found to suppress not only PMA- or TNF-induced, but also constitutive, HIV-enhancer activity concomitant to an inhibition of NF-kappa B binding activity in both lymphoblastoid T (J.Jhan) and monocytic (U937) cell lines.This was also true for KBF (p50 homodimer) binding activity in U937 cells.Secretion of TNF, the product of another NF-kappa B-dependent gene, was abolished by BHA in PMA-stimulated U937 cells.The anti-oxidative effect of BHA was accompanied by an increase in thiol, but not glutathione, content in stimulated and unstimulated T cell, whereas TNF stimulation itself barely modified the cellular thiol level.Oxidative stress obtained by the addition of H2O2 to the culture medium of J.Jhan or U937 cells could not by itself induce NF-kappa B activation.These observations suggest that TNF and PMA do not lead to NF-kappa B activation through induction of changes in the cell redox status.Rather, TNF and PMA can exert their effect only if cells are in an appropriate redox status, because prior modification toward reduction with BHA treatment prevents this activation.It appears that a basal redox equilibrium tending toward oxidation is a prerequisite for full activation of transduction pathways regulating the activity of NF-kappa B-dependent genes.
1510878:Mitogen stimulation of T-cells increases c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels, AP-1 binding and AP-1 transcriptional activity.We have analysed the effect of mitogenic lectins on c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels as well as on activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding and enhancer activity in Jurkat T-cells.Both c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels were increased after Con A and PHA stimulation.Since T-cell stimulation increases both intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP levels and activates protein kinase C (PKC), the possible involvement of these intracellular messengers in c-Fos and c-Jun induction was tested.PMA, which directly activates PKC, mimicked the effect of the lectins on c-Fos and c-Jun, but elevation of either intracellular Ca2+ or cAMP levels had little or no effect.The mitogen-induced increase of c-Fos and c-Jun immunoreactivity was inhibited by H-7, a kinase inhibitor with relatively high specificity for PKC, and less efficiently by H-8, a structurally related kinase inhibitor less active on PKC, but more active on cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases.Con A stimulation was found to increase both binding of AP-1 to the AP-1 consensus sequence, TRE, and AP-1 enhancer activity, in Jurkat cells.PMA was also found to increase the AP-1 enhancer activity, whereas elevation of Ca2+ or cAMP had only minor effects.We conclude that stimulation with mitogenic lectins is sufficient to increase both c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels, AP-1 binding and AP-1 enhancer activity in Jurkat cells and that they act via mechanisms that could involve the activation of PKC.
1347914:Modulation of normal erythroid differentiation by the endogenous thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors: a possible target for v-erbA oncogene action.The v-erbA oncogene, a mutated version of the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (c-erbA/TR-alpha), inhibits erythroid differentiation and constitutively represses transcription of certain erythrocyte genes, suggesting a normal function of the proto-oncogene c-erbA in erythropoiesis.Here we demonstrate that the endogenous thyroid hormone receptor alpha (c-erbA/TR-alpha) and the closely related retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR-alpha) play a role in the regulation of normal erythroid differentiation.Retinoic acid (RA) distinctly modulated the erythroid differentiation program of normal erythroid progenitors and erythroblasts reversibly transformed by a conditional tyrosine kinase oncogene.When added pulsewise to immature cells, differentiation was accelerated while more mature cells underwent premature cell death.Thyroid hormone (T3) alone caused similar but weaker effects.Interestingly, T3 strongly enhanced the action of RA, suggesting cooperative action of the two receptors in modulating erythroid differentiation.Expression of the human RAR-alpha in receptor-negative erythroblasts conferred RA-induced regulation of differentiation to the otherwise unresponsive cells, thus showing that the RAR-alpha is essential for the RA effect.Likewise, enhanced expression of exogenous c-erbA/TR-alpha in erythroblasts rendered them susceptible to modulation of differentiation by T3, suggesting a similar function of both receptors.
1406939:The candidate oncoprotein Bcl-3 is an antagonist of p50/NF-kappa B-mediated inhibition.The candidate oncogene bcl-3 was discovered as a translocation into the immunoglobulin alpha-locus in some cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemias.The protein Bcl-3 contains seven so-called ankyrin repeats.Similar repeat motifs are found in a number of diverse regulatory proteins but the motifs of Bcl-3 are most closely related to those found in I kappa B proteins in which the ankyrin repeat domain is thought to be directly involved in inhibition of NF-kappa B activity.No biological function has yet been described for Bcl-3, but it was noted recently that Bcl-3 interferes with DNA-binding of the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B in vitro.Here we demonstrate that Bcl-3 can aid kappa B site-dependent transcription in vivo by counteracting the inhibitory effects of p50/NF-kappa B homodimers.Bcl-3 may therefore aid activation of select NF-kappa B-regulated genes, including those of the human immunodeficiency virus.
1645452:The human myelomonocytic cell line U-937 as a model for studying alterations in steroid-induced monokine gene expression: marked enhancement of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated interleukin-1 beta messenger RNA levels by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3], is a potent regulator of human monocyte/macrophage function in vitro.To establish a model for 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulation of human monocyte monokine synthesis, three human cell lines (U-937, THP-1, and HL-60) were examined for: 1) the presence of functional 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors; 2) the accumulation of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) mRNA and IL-1 beta protein in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS); and 3) the regulation of this response by 1,25-(OH)2D3.All three cell lines expressed vitamin D receptor and had increased levels of IL-1 beta mRNA in response to LPS.Preincubation of cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 augmented IL-1 beta mRNA levels only in U-937 and HL-60 cells.From these data, and taking into consideration their state of differentiation and relative ease of culture, U-937 was chosen over HL-60 and THP-1 as the cell line we further characterized.In U-937 cells, optimum time and dose of pretreatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 were determined to be 12-24 h at a receptor saturating concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10 nM).Preincubation of cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 had no effect on the time course of IL-1 beta mRNA appearance in response to LPS.However, exposure of U-937 cells to 1,25-(OH)2D3 increased by 200% the level of IL-1 beta mRNA detected and decreased by three orders of magnitude the concentration of LPS required to achieve steady state mRNA levels equivalent to those observed in U-937 cells not preincubated with the hormone.2+o
2026605:Tissue-specific expression of the platelet GPIIb gene.One of the major objectives in the study of thrombogenesis is to determine the mechanisms by which a hematopoietic progenitor is activated and committed to the megakaryocytic lineage.Recent development of primary cultures of human megakaryocytes and the molecular cloning of genes that are specific to this lineage offer the possibility of getting some insights into the genetic mechanisms that control megakaryocytopoiesis.One gene of interest is the glycoprotein IIb (GPIIb) gene; GPIIb, the alpha subunit of the platelet cytoadhesin GPIIb-IIIa, is produced in megakaryocytes at an early stage of the differentiation, whereas the other subunit of this complex, GPIIIa, is expressed in other cells.For these reasons, the 5'-flanking region of the GPIIb gene was used to identify the regions that interact with DNA-binding nuclear factors.A fragment extending from -643 to +33 is capable of controlling the tissue-specific expression of the CAT gene in transfection experiments.Within this region, we have identified several sequences that are implicated in DNA protein interactions as shown in DNAse I footprints and gel mobility shift assays.One region, centered at -54, is similar to a nuclear factor E1-binding site, and a region located at position -233 contains a CCAAT motif.Two domains centered at positions -345 and -540, respectively, bind proteins that are present in megakaryocytic cells and nonrelated cells as well.Finally, two other domains, located at positions -460 and -510, interact with proteins that are only present in megakaryocytic cells.In addition, deletion of the region containing these two domains results in a significant decrease of the promoter activity.It is very likely that these domains bind megakaryocyte-specific nuclear proteins acting as positive transcription factors.
1652603:Lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor binding during depression and after clinical recovery.Lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor binding parameters were studied in 15 severely depressed patients during depression and after clinical recovery, and in 15 healthy controls.There was no difference in glucocorticoid receptor number or affinity between depressed patients and recovered or control subjects.Afternoon ACTH and cortisol concentrations did not differ significantly between the three groups.No relationship could be established between glucocorticoid receptor binding and antidepressant medication.These data support the view of an impaired ligand-induced plasticity of glucocorticoid receptor regulation rather than the hypothesis of decreased glucocorticoid receptor numbers during depression.
1653950:USF-related transcription factor, HIV-TF1, stimulates transcription of human immunodeficiency virus-1.The transcription factor HIV-TF1, which binds to a region about 60 bp upstream from the enhancer of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), was purified from human B cells.HIV-TF1 had a molecular weight of 39,000.Binding of HIV-TF1 to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) activated transcription from the HIV promoter in vitro.The HIV-TF1-binding site in HIV LTR was similar to the site recognized by upstream stimulatory factor (USF) in the adenovirus major late promoter.DNA-binding properties of HIV-TF1 suggested that HIV-TF1 might be identical or related to USF.Interestingly, treatment of purified HIV-TF1 by phosphatase greatly reduced its DNA-binding activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of HIV-TF1 was essential for DNA binding.The disruption of HIV-TF1-binding site induced a 60% decrease in the level of transcription from the HIV promoter in vivo.These results suggest that HIV-TF1 is involved in transcriptional regulation of HIV-1.
2011512:Multiple Oct2 isoforms are generated by alternative splicing.The interaction of the Oct2 transcription factor with the cognate octamer motif ATGCAAAT is a critical determinant of the lymphoid-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes.Ectopic expression of cloned Oct2 cDNA was shown to be sufficient to reconstitute at least some aspects of this regulation in non-lymphoid cells.We describe the isolation and characterization of multiple cDNAs encoding mouse Oct2 from a mature B-cell line and we show that a variety of isoforms of this transcription factor is generated from a single gene by an alternative splicing mechanism.All the isoforms retain the previously characterized POU-domain and are therefore able to bind to the octamer motif.Different amounts of the various isoforms are present within the same B-cell regardless of the developmental stage of B-cell differentiation and at least some of the isoforms are conserved between mouse and humans.In cotransfection experiments we show that all the isoforms are able to activate an octamer containing promoter element in fibroblasts revealing an unexpected functional redundancy.Finally, we show that one of the isoforms encodes the previously described lymphoid-specific Oct2B protein which has been suggested to be involved in the function of the octamer motif in the context of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) enhancer.
2283805:[Glucocorticoid receptors in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with bronchial asthma]Quantitation of glucocorticoid receptors (GCR) and the study of their affinity for glucocorticosteroids (GCS) were made in peripheral blood lymphocytes of bronchial asthma (BA) patients in consideration of GCR treatment and serum levels of endogenous cortisol.It is stated that GCR of healthy controls and GCS-untreated patients outnumbered those of cortisol-dependent BA patients on hormone therapy.Following discontinuation of glucocorticoid drugs GCR count in cortisol-dependent BA tends to rise.Endogenous cortisol has no effect on GCR level estimated by 3H-triamcinolone acetonide.
2172422:Immunohistochemical study of steroid hormones and an estrogen binding assay in malignant soft tissue tumors.Immunohistochemically, the immunoreaction against 5 steroid hormone anti-sera (estradiol, estriol, cortisol, progesterone and testosterone) was examined in 39 cases with the malignant soft tissue tumors (fibrosarcoma: 8, malignant fibrous histiocytoma: 6, rhabdomyosarcoma: 10, leiomyosarcoma: 10, liposarcoma: 5).Seventeen cases revealed distinct immunostaining against at least 1 of the 5 steroid hormones.Immunostained tumor cells were more frequently distributed in the area where tumor cell infiltration was more invasive.The majority of the positive cases occurred in female cases.Furthermore, the existence of estrogen receptor (estrogen binding activity) was examined histochemically in 39 cases and it was detected in 8.We concluded that steroid hormones might be closely related to tumor cell infiltration of some malignant soft tissue tumors.
2111447:Involvement of a second lymphoid-specific enhancer element in the regulation of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene expression.To determine whether enhancer elements in addition to the highly conserved octamer (OCTA)-nucleotide motif are important for lymphoid-specific expression of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) gene, we have investigated the effect of mutating the binding site for a putative additional lymphoid-specific transcription factor, designated NF-microB, in the murine IgH enhancer.We demonstrate that the NF-microB-binding site plays a critical role in the IgH enhancer, because mutation of the microB DNA motif decreased transcriptional activity of the IgH enhancer in cells of the B-cell lineage but not in nonlymphoid cells.This effect was comparable to or even stronger than the effect of a mutation in the OCTA site.Moreover, combined mutation of both microB and OCTA sites further reduced enhancer activity in lymphoid cells.Interestingly, alteration of either the microB or E3 site in a 70-base-pair fragment of the IgH enhancer that lacks the binding site for OCTA abolished enhancer activity in lymphoid cells completely.Nevertheless, a multimer of the microB motif alone showed no enhancer activity.DNase footprinting analysis corroborated the functional data showing that a lymphoid-specific protein binds to the microB DNA motif.Our results suggest that the microB element is a new crucial element important for lymphoid-specific expression of the IgH gene but that interaction with another enhancer element is essential for its activity.
1964088:Suppression of signals required for activation of transcription factor NF-kappa B in cells constitutively expressing the HTLV-I Tax protein.Transient short-term expression of the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) leads to activation of the pleiotropic transcription factor NF-kappa B.Consistent with findings obtained with transient expression assays, we observed marked accumulation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B in the nucleus of Namalwa B lymphoid cells, which constitutively express Tax.In contrast, NF-kappa B activity was not detected in the nucleus following long-term expression of Tax in Jurkat T lymphocytes.The ability of both mitogens and cytokines to activate NF-kappa B was also blocked in Jurkat cells constitutively expressing Tax.However, the activation of other mitogen-inducible transcription factors, such as Fos and Jun, was unaffected.Thus, depending on the cellular environment, the short- and long-term effects of Tax expression can be quite different.Consequently, one function of Tax in cells infected with HTLV-I might involve cell-type-specific suppression, as opposed to activation, of <cons lex="distinct_signal_pathways" sem="G#other_name">distinct signal pathways</cons>.The cells lines described here should be useful for the delineation of signaling pathways utilized in the selective regulation of gene expression.
7565415:Regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and cytokine gene expression in myeloid cells by NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factors.CD4+ macrophages in tissues such as lung, skin, and lymph nodes, promyelocytic cells in bone marrow, and peripheral blood monocytes serve as important targets and reservoirs for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication.HIV-1-infected myeloid cells are often diminished in their ability to participate in chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and intracellular killing.HIV-1 infection of myeloid cells can lead to the expression of surface receptors associated with cellular activation and/or differentiation that increase the responsiveness of these cells to cytokines secreted by neighboring cells as well as to bacteria or other pathogens.Enhancement of HIV-1 replication is related in part to increased DNA-binding activity of cellular transcription factors such as NF-kappa B.NF-kappa B binds to the HIV-1 enhancer region of the long terminal repeat and contributes to the inducibility of HIV-1 gene expression in response to multiple activating agents.Phosphorylation and degradation of the cytoplasmic inhibitor I kappa B alpha are crucial regulatory events in the activation of NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity.Both N- and C-terminal residues of I kappa B alpha are required for inducer-mediated degradation.Chronic HIV-1 infection of myeloid cells leads to constitutive NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity and provides an intranuclear environment capable of perpetuating HIV-1 replication.Increased intracellular stores of latent NF-kappa B may also result in rapid inducibility of NF-kappa B-dependent cytokine gene expression.In response to secondary pathogenic infections or antigenic challenge, cytokine gene expression is rapidly induced, enhanced, and sustained over prolonged periods in HIV-1-infected myeloid cells compared with uninfected cells.Elevated levels of several inflammatory cytokines have been detected in the sera of HIV-1-infected individuals.Secretion of myeloid cell-derived cytokines may both increase virus production and contribute to AIDS-associated disorders.
